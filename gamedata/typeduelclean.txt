Tell Baker that I told him all that I know already.
Tell him I want to live in peace, understand?
That it's no use to go on tormenting me!
I know nothing at all about that case of coins.
Now that gold has disappeared.
But if he'd listened to me, we could have avoided this altogether.
I went to the Army court.
They couldn't uncover any more.
I can't tell Baker what happened to the money.
Go back and tell him that!
That's not what I'm being paid for.
I'm only interested in what name Jackson's hiding under now!
Why do you think Jackson may be assuming another name?
I would have found him already.
When I start off to find somebody, I find them.
That's why they pay me.
What is Baker paying you?
What does he pay you for murdering me?
That's what he calls himself now.
Not enough for you, huh?
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again!
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.
I think his idea was that I kill you.
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.
But you don't look like the one who will collect it.
A couple of steps back.
How much you worth now?
¡ Hijo de puta que te parió!
Cut me loose! Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!
Cut me loose! Cut me loose!
You can still save yourself.
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
You swine! You son of a bitch!
You're brave with a man who's tied up!
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.
Cut it out! Cut it out!
So, you're an honest farmer.
Who says so? You can't even read.
Roll it up. Roll it up!
I'll give you a good idea where you can put it.
To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies and all who gave birth to you!
Hey, everybody, look! Look! He's giving him the filthy money!
But you won't enjoy any of that money, not a penny.
If there's justice, that money will go to the undertakers!
Every penny of it. You know who you are?
You want to know whose son you are?
You don't, I do. Everybody does.
You're the son of a thousand fathers!
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her. I never hurt anybody!
May God have mercy on his soul. Proceed!
Know how much you're worth now?
There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend.
Listen, the neck at the end of the rope is mine!
So, the next time, I want more than half!
But if you miss, you had better miss very well.
What'd you find out, Shorty?
If you ask me, it seems like a book!
The thing that wasn't saved, though, was the coins.
He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.
But you don't know just who you're lookin' for, and I do!
And when he's found, I'd be scared to be put in his shoes!
The poor guy's minus an eye.
He lives with a girl called Maria, who'll tell you.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.
Hand me down a whiskey!
Glad they got him. A man guilty of all those crimes!
People with ropes around their necks don't always hang.
Even a filthy beggar like that has a protecting angel.
Of all these crimes, the accused has made a full, spontaneous confession.
Therefore, we condemn him to be hung by the neck until dead.
May the Lord have mercy on his soul. Proceed.
Let's get the hell out of here!
What are you saying? Anybody can miss a shot?
Nobody misses when I'm at the end of the rope!
You never had a rope around your neck. Well, I'm going to tell you something.
When that rope starts to pull tight, you can feel the devil bite your ass!
I mean, our partnership is untied.
I'll keep the money, and you can have the rope.
The way back to town is only    miles.
If you save your breath, I feel a man like you could manage it.
You filthy bastard! Come here!
Come here! Cut this rope off! Get off that horse!
Get off that horse! You filthy coward!
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up by your tongue.
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Such ingratitude, after all the times I've saved your life.
¡ Hijo de una gran puta!
What do you want with me?
Go on talking about Bill Carson.
You were calling to him in the dark!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago, and went away with his unit.
Which company? Where'd he go?
They left for Santa Fe.
That's all I know. I swear!
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.
Here's where I keep the best ones.
This morning I heard the whole thing.
That's why these Southerners are getting out!
You see, as soon as these cowards hear there are blue shirts around, they run.
They carry gold, not paper dollars. And they're going to beat the South.
Look, see that one with the white beard sitting in the wagon?
General Sibley. He looks dead. He's finally getting out of our hair.
Hooray for Dixie! Hooray, hooray for Dixie!
Where's the owner of that horse?
The war has frightened me already.
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!
You leave him be! He doesn't know who rides every horse!
You stay quiet, old hen!
Upstairs. Upstairs, in Room   señor.
You rotten criminals, how dare you?!
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.
Take off that pistol belt.
Even when Judas hanged himself, there was a storm, too.
That could be cannon fire.
Cannon fire or storm, it's all the same to you!
You ever see this before, my friend?
Throw it over the roof beam.
Now, make sure the rope is tight!
It's got to hold the weight of a pig!
Now, put the rope around your neck!
It's too big for your neck?
We'll fix that right away.
A little different than yours.
I don't shoot the rope.
I shoot the legs off the stool!
Move, come on, let's go!
I don't know. As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.
They say people with fair skin can't take too much.
Like that, you won't have to carry so much.
Another     miles of beautiful sunbaked sand.
Even the armies are afraid to march through there.
Sibley's men are retreating up there.
One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.
What was it you told me the last time?
"If you save your breath, I feel a man like you could manage it."
And if you won't manage it, you'll die.
After you, please. Start walking.
Come on, Blondie, we don't have very far to go. Only    miles.
Only eight and a half hours more before sunset.
Who the hell are you?
My name's Bill Carson now.
My name is Jackson. Not Carson.
Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather. What was that you said about the dollars?
I hid the gold. The gold is safe!
Have a name? Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk!
You talk first, eh? I'll give you the water later!
But it must have a name or a number on it.
Don't die! I'll get you water!
Stay there. Don't move, I'll get you water.
If you do that, you'll always be poor.
Just like the greasy rat that you are.
What did he tell you?
Don't die! I'm your friend.
Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!
I'll help you. I'll help you!
Don't move. I'll be right back. I'll get the water.
Don't die like that pig.
Don't drink! It's no good for you.
Blondie, what's the matter? Please don't die!
I've got a very sick man here.
But we have no more beds here.
He is away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.
It doesn't matter. For the moment, we'll take very good care of my friend.
Father, is he still breathing?
All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
Put him in my cell.
Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.
Look out for him, please. He's like a brother to me!
Father, did he speak? Did he say anything?
Did he ask for me? Did he speak about anything?
No, he hasn't spoken as yet. But you mustn't worry.
He's both young and strong. That's what's kept him going until now.
He should regain his strength in a very short time.
Thank you, Father. You don't know how much this boy's life means to me!
The old Father tells me you'll be up and around in a few days.
You're very lucky to have me so close when it happened.
Think, if you'd been on your own.
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
We're all alone in the world.
I have you, you have me.
Only for a little while, I mean.
It had to happen now.
What a dirty rotten trick of fate!
We could have all that money in our hands.
I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would do the same thing.
It's all over for you now.
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
It's my fault! Mine, mine!
I would tell about the gold. Yes, yes I would!
I would tell the name on the grave.
After all, what good is the money to you if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery.
But you know how many graves there are there?
Coffee? Please tell me the name.
I swear it! I'll always honor your memory!
But if I get that name from you, I'll give you water!
All right, you dirty skunk, get your ass off the bed!
Come on, come on, the party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
This is something I have to look into. It'll only take a minute. Get moving.
I don't know the right thing!
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.
Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.
Let's talk about you. It's more important.
Only now do you think of them?
To begin after nine years?
Our mother has been dead a long time.
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.
He asked for you to be there.
But there was only me.
Outside of evil, what else have you managed to do?
It seems to me you once had a wife someplace.
Not one, lots of them!
One here, one there, wherever I found them.
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
What good would that be?
Just keep on the way you're going.
The Lord have mercy on your soul.
You think you're better than I am.
You chose your way, I chose mine.
You talk of our mother and father.
You remember when you left to become a priest.
I must have been ten, twelve. I don't remember which, but I stayed.
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I am going to tell you something.
I didn't tell you my brother was in charge here.
Everything, like the pope almost.
He's in charge in Rome.
My brother, he says to me: "Stay, brother, don't go home.
"We never see each other.
"Here, there's plenty to eat and drink. Bring your friend, too."
Whenever we see each other, he never lets me go.
It's always the same story.
My brother, he's crazy about me.
Well, after a meal, there's nothing like a good cigar.
They're gray like us. Let's say "hello" to them and then get going.
Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!
God is with us because he hates the Yanks, too!
God is not on our side 'cause he hates idiots also.
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.
Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.
I like big fat men like you.
When they fall, they make more noise.
And sometimes they never get up.
The captain wants to see you right away.
Be sure these two get good treatment.
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that? Good treatment!
There's hundreds of prisoners out there and only a few men to guard them.
What am I supposed to do? I have to have respect!
I think that you'll manage to gain their respect by treating them better!
Are our men treated that well in Andersonville Camp?
I don't give a goddamn what they do in Andersonville!
I know the prisoners here are being robbed systematically.
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't permit any such trickery!
Just as long as you're the commandant.
You and the others better lay low for a few days.
I'll keep this. You go. Wallace will let you know.
Angel Eyes said for us to lay low for a few days.
But we'll keep close enough to keep an eye on things.
Come on, saddle your horses.
It's been a long time!
I knew it, I knew it!
The minute I saw you, I said to myself:
"And he never forgets a friend!"
I never forget old friends, Tuco.
It's good to see old friends again.
And you do have a lot to talk about, haven't you?
Was it hard crossing the desert?
Especially if you don't have anything to drink.
Why are you going under the name of Bill Carson, now?
One name is as good as another.
Not wise to use your own name.
Like you, I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?
Yes, very good for the digestion.
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
Bill Carson's name is written on it.
Was Carson dead or alive when you found him?
What'd he tell you about the money?
I don't know what you're talking about!
You can sure consider yourself much luckier than your pal.
Wallace will punch your friend as long as the song goes.
So many of us have had a session in there.
I have nothing to tell you!
What did he say about the money?
It's buried in a grave.
At the Sad Hill Cemetery.
The war's over for you.
We're going for a ride.
You're not going to give me the same treatment?
You changed partners, but you still got the same deal.
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
It should make it easier than just one.
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost? Where's the Rebel going?
To hell with a rope around his neck and a price on his head.
That's a lot of money for a head.
I bet they didn't even pay you a penny for your arm.
You're a lot luckier than that one there.
You get some proper rope, and you're all finished.
And there isn't any partner, this time, to shoot you down.
Sure would like to put your paw on it, huh?
I would like to piss, it's rough.
I've been shaken up in this train nearly ten hours, now.
You smell like a pig already!
Let's try not to make things any worse.
I can't while you're watching me.
You made a lot of noise my friend, huh?
You don't wanna break our friendship, huh?
Clemens, take care of the horses.
I've been looking for you for eight months!
Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me.
I had lots of time to learn how to shoot with my left.
When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk.
Just a minute. I'll be right there.
Just give me a little time to get dressed, and I'll open up.
Put your drawers on, and take your gun off.
How the hell did you get out of that pigsty?
My own way. I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.
You talked, you traitor! You talked!
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here, now.
So, only you know your half of the secret?
I'm very happy you are working with me!
I'll get dressed, I kill him, and be right back.
Listen, I forgot to mention.
He's not alone. There's five of 'em.
So, that's why you came to Tuco.
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all!
They shot him at close range.
The other one will be along.
They'll come looking for us.
I want that blond alive!
You back there. Come on, let's go!
Were you going to die alone?
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
Like a cemetery, for instance?
There should be a bridge across that river.
We better wait for nightfall.
I got a good sense of where I'm going.
Come along now. Follow me.
We found them near the perimeter, sir.
Where do you hail from?
Your reason for being around here?
We want to enlist, general!
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.
It sure as hell might be you today, so go write your will.
So, you want to enlist.
You got to take a test to prove it.
You've got a career. At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel!
Like it says in the manual.
You've got every qualification to become expert in the use of weapons.
This is the most potent weapon in war!
The fighting spirit is in this bottle!
The shooting hasn't begun, yet.
Yes, because soon you can join the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.
The Reb's have decided that damn bridge is the key to this whole area.
A flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
Otherwise, the key'll get rusty and just be a spot on the wall.
Both sides want the bridge intact!
Intact is how the South wants it. And we want it intact, too.
I've done a lot worse.
Why not really blow it up, captain?
Yeah, captain, it's nothing. Let's scare the hell out of them!
I've been dreaming about it.
I've even worked out a plan.
But what I lack is the guts.
They're beginning the daily slaughter, right on time.
Captain! All companies are awaiting your orders.
It looks like the captain is really asking for a bullet in his guts!
I've never seen so many men wasted so badly.
I've a feeling it's really gonna be a good long battle.
The money is on the other side of the river.
Amigo, I said on the other side. That's enough.
But while the Confederates are there, we can't get across.
What would happen if somebody were to blow up that bridge?
Then these idiots would go somewhere else to fight!
Doctor, quick! The captain's wounded!
A little of this will help.
You realize we might be risking our lives?
If I get killed, you'll never get your hands on all that beautiful money.
It sure would be a pity.
Can you help me live a little more?
Why don't we tell each other our half of the secret?
It'd be a lot easier with that.
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.
If you shoot me, you won't see a cent of that money.
'Cause there's nothin' in there.
You thought I'd trust you?
We're gonna have to earn it.
I'll write the name on the bottom of this stone.
You pig! You wanted to get me killed? When'd you unload it?
There's no name on it!
There's no name here, either.
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me:
"There's a grave marked 'unknown', right beside Arch Stanton."
It's money! It's all ours, Blondie!
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.
I want you to stand up there, and put your head in that noose.
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost? Where's the Rebel going?
To hell with a rope around his neck and a price on his head.
That's a lot of money for a head.
I bet they didn't even pay you a penny for your arm.
