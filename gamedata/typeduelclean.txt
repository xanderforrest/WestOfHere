Now that gold has disappeared.
I went to the Army court.
They couldn't uncover any more.
Go back and tell him that!
That's not what I'm being paid for.
I would have found him already.
That's why they pay me.
What is Baker paying you?
That's what he calls himself now.
Not enough for you, huh?
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again!
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.
A couple of steps back.
How much you worth now?
¡ Hijo de puta que te parió!
Cut me loose! Cut me loose!
You can still save yourself.
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
You swine! You son of a bitch!
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.
Cut it out! Cut it out!
So, you're an honest farmer.
Who says so? You can't even read.
Roll it up. Roll it up!
You don't, I do. Everybody does.
You're the son of a thousand fathers!
Know how much you're worth now?
What'd you find out, Shorty?
He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.
The poor guy's minus an eye.
Hand me down a whiskey!
Let's get the hell out of here!
I mean, our partnership is untied.
You filthy bastard! Come here!
Get off that horse! You filthy coward!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
¡ Hijo de una gran puta!
What do you want with me?
Go on talking about Bill Carson.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know where he is.
Which company? Where'd he go?
They left for Santa Fe.
That's all I know. I swear!
Here's where I keep the best ones.
This morning I heard the whole thing.
That's why these Southerners are getting out!
Hooray for Dixie! Hooray, hooray for Dixie!
Where's the owner of that horse?
The war has frightened me already.
You stay quiet, old hen!
Upstairs. Upstairs, in Room   señor.
You rotten criminals, how dare you?!
Take off that pistol belt.
That could be cannon fire.
You ever see this before, my friend?
Throw it over the roof beam.
Now, make sure the rope is tight!
Now, put the rope around your neck!
It's too big for your neck?
We'll fix that right away.
A little different than yours.
I don't shoot the rope.
I shoot the legs off the stool!
Move, come on, let's go!
Another     miles of beautiful sunbaked sand.
Sibley's men are retreating up there.
One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.
After you, please. Start walking.
Who the hell are you?
My name's Bill Carson now.
My name is Jackson. Not Carson.
Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.
Have a name? Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk!
Don't die! I'll get you water!
What did he tell you?
Don't die! I'm your friend.
Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!
I'll help you. I'll help you!
Don't die like that pig.
Don't drink! It's no good for you.
Blondie, what's the matter? Please don't die!
I've got a very sick man here.
But we have no more beds here.
He is away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.
Father, is he still breathing?
Put him in my cell.
Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.
Think, if you'd been on your own.
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
We're all alone in the world.
I have you, you have me.
Only for a little while, I mean.
It had to happen now.
What a dirty rotten trick of fate!
I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
It's all over for you now.
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
It's my fault! Mine, mine!
I know the name of the cemetery.
Coffee? Please tell me the name.
Come on, come on, the party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
I don't know the right thing!
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.
Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.
Let's talk about you. It's more important.
Only now do you think of them?
To begin after nine years?
That's why I was away.
He asked for you to be there.
But there was only me.
Not one, lots of them!
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
What good would that be?
Just keep on the way you're going.
The Lord have mercy on your soul.
You think you're better than I am.
You chose your way, I chose mine.
You talk of our mother and father.
I tried, but it was no good.
Everything, like the pope almost.
He's in charge in Rome.
"We never see each other.
It's always the same story.
My brother, he's crazy about me.
Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.
Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.
I like big fat men like you.
When they fall, they make more noise.
And sometimes they never get up.
Be sure these two get good treatment.
Just as long as you're the commandant.
Come on, saddle your horses.
It's been a long time!
I knew it, I knew it!
"And he never forgets a friend!"
I never forget old friends, Tuco.
It's good to see old friends again.
Was it hard crossing the desert?
One name is as good as another.
Not wise to use your own name.
Yes, very good for the digestion.
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
Bill Carson's name is written on it.
What'd he tell you about the money?
I don't know what you're talking about!
I have nothing to tell you!
What did he say about the money?
It's buried in a grave.
At the Sad Hill Cemetery.
The war's over for you.
We're going for a ride.
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
I would like to piss, it's rough.
You smell like a pig already!
I can't while you're watching me.
You don't wanna break our friendship, huh?
Clemens, take care of the horses.
Just a minute. I'll be right there.
You talked, you traitor! You talked!
Listen, I forgot to mention.
He's not alone. There's five of 'em.
So, that's why you came to Tuco.
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all!
They shot him at close range.
The other one will be along.
They'll come looking for us.
I want that blond alive!
You back there. Come on, let's go!
Were you going to die alone?
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
Like a cemetery, for instance?
We better wait for nightfall.
Come along now. Follow me.
We found them near the perimeter, sir.
Where do you hail from?
Your reason for being around here?
We want to enlist, general!
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.
So, you want to enlist.
Like it says in the manual.
The fighting spirit is in this bottle!
The shooting hasn't begun, yet.
A flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
Both sides want the bridge intact!
I've done a lot worse.
Why not really blow it up, captain?
I've been dreaming about it.
I've even worked out a plan.
But what I lack is the guts.
Captain! All companies are awaiting your orders.
Doctor, quick! The captain's wounded!
A little of this will help.
It sure would be a pity.
It'd be a lot easier with that.
'Cause there's nothin' in there.
You thought I'd trust you?
We're gonna have to earn it.
There's no name on it!
There's no name here, either.
It's money! It's all ours, Blondie!
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.
I would like to piss, it's rough.
You smell like a pig already!
I can't while you're watching me.
You don't wanna break our friendship, huh?
Clemens, take care of the horses.
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.
