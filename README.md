<h1>West of Here</h1>
A Spaghetti Western inspired click'n'shoot platformer.

![The current state of the game](https://i.imgur.com/HV5F9hz.png)

This project was started to get familiar with the Pygame library and game development in general. In the past week it has
gone from nothing at all to a solid platform to build different game mods on top of. 
<br><br>
My main problem at the moment is focussing too much on the backend/features, not the actual gameplay. As such,
lots is there, there's just not a lot to do with it at the moment. 
<br><br>
Originally I saw this becoming a Mario-esque platformer, but at the moment am leaning more towards having
multiple types of 2d scroller games in one. This means there could be duck-hunter/space invaders minigame
(with a western theme, of course) that can earn you upgrades and buffs in the "Mario-esque" part of the game.



<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<li>Implement any gameplay aspect at all</li>
<li>Tilemap Creator (think Mario Maker, with a smaller budget)</li>
<li><del>Background/Tileset</del> with Parallax</li>
<li><del>Gun Mechanics (including something to shoot)</del></li>
<li><del>Gun Animations</del> + Logic (reloading, <del>delays</del>)</li>
<li>Enemy logic</li>

<br><br>
<h2>Credits</h2>
I've tried to do as much of the game myself as possible, but quickly realised I'm pretty bad at art.<br><br>
I commissioned an artist to draw and animate the main character, and another to design the buildings and
tileset the game uses. 
<br><br>
There is a font used in the debug overlay that'll probably be used more in the game later as well, I found it
on fontspace under the SIL Open Font License, meaning I'm allowed to use it commercially.<br>

The sound effects in the game currently come from The Dollars Trilogy movies, so will have to be changed
if there is ever a more official release than here on Github.
<br><br>
The soundtrack over the top is from the youtuber OkamiDeluxe, who I am trying to find a way to contact but
allowed numerous other people to use their track with credit so I am hoping they'd be ok with me doing this
as a temporary solution.
