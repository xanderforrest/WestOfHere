<h1>West of Here</h1>
A Spaghetti Western inspired click'n'shoot platformer.

![The current state of the game](https://i.imgur.com/HV5F9hz.png)

This project was started to get familiar with the Pygame library and game development in general. 
<br><br>
The focus has largely been on building a solid foundation for game modes to be built upon, and I plan to make that
as easy for others as possible, by building tools to speed up development and make life easier (such as a tilemap maker/
events system for the add-on minigames)
<br><br>
Originally I saw this becoming a Mario-esque platformer, but at the moment am leaning more towards having
multiple types of 2d scroller games in one. This means there could be duck-hunter/space invaders minigame
(with a western theme, of course) that can earn you upgrades and buffs in the "Mario-esque" part of the game.



<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<li>Implement any gameplay aspect at all</li>
<li>Rewrite Tilemap object to allow for more interaction + layering</li>
<li><del>Tilemap Creator</del> (think Mario Maker, <del>with a smaller budget</del>)</li>
<li><del>Background/Tileset</del> with Parallax</li>
<li><del>Gun Animations</del> + Logic (reloading, <del>delays</del>)</li>
<li>Enemy logic</li>

<h2>Credits</h2>
I've tried to do as much of the game myself as possible, but quickly realised I'm pretty bad at art.<br><br>
I commissioned an artist to draw and animate the main character, and another to design the buildings and
tileset the game uses. 
<br><br>
I found a font on fontspace under the SIL Open Font License, meaning I'm allowed to use it commercially.
This is used for the title and other text in the game.<br>

The sound effects in the game currently come from The Dollars Trilogy movies, so will have to be changed
if there is ever a more official release than here on Github.
<br><br>
The soundtrack over the top is from the youtuber OkamiDeluxe, who I am trying to find a way to contact but
allowed numerous other people to use their track with credit so I am hoping they'd be ok with me doing this
as a temporary solution.
